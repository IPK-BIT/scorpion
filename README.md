Scorpion is a Dashboard that collects and visualizes Key Performance Indicators (KPI) for services. KPIs are measurements we agreed upon to monitor how well a service is performing. Based on trends over a year this will give insights into what measures to take. Scorpion is the tool that is used to collect the results of all services in the Service Monitoring and generate plots and overviews for the review processs.
