# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We kindly ask for your understanding as we work to improve Scorpion. Currently, we recommend using it through a central hosted instance, which we update regularly.
We plan to provide version releases with deployable images at a later point in time. In the meantime, we encourage you to check the repository regularly for new updates.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Should you become aware of any potential security risks, we kindly request that you [privately report a security vulnerability](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing-information-about-vulnerabilities/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability#privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability).
